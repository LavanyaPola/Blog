            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was invented by Tim Berners-Lee. He developed it in 1991 while working at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland. HTML was created as a way to structure and present content on the World Wide Web, enabling the creation and sharing of documents that could be interlinked using hyperlinks. Tim Berners-Lee's invention of HTML, along with the first web browser (called WorldWideWeb, later renamed Nexus) and the first web server (called CERN HTTPd), laid the foundation for the modern web. HTML has since evolved through various versions, becoming more sophisticated and capable of handling a wide range of multimedia and interactive content.

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was invented by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie. He proposed the concept in 1994 while working at CERN, the same institution where Tim Berners-Lee developed HTML. CSS was officially adopted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in December 1996. CSS was created to separate the content of web pages from their presentation, allowing for more flexibility and control in specifying the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of web pages. This separation of content and style makes it easier to maintain and update the design of a website, as changes can be made in one place without affecting the underlying HTML. The development of CSS has gone through several versions, with CSS3 being the latest major specification, introducing many new features and capabilities to enhance the styling and layout of web pages.</a></p>

            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Originally named Mocha, it was later renamed to LiveScript, and then finally to JavaScript. JavaScript was created in just 10 days to provide a scripting language for web browsers that could make web pages interactive. It was intended to complement Java, which was used for more complex web applications, and to be a lightweight programming language that could be easily integrated with HTML. JavaScript's initial implementation was in Netscape Navigator 2.0, and it quickly became an essential part of the web development stack alongside HTML and CSS. Over the years, JavaScript has evolved significantly and is now a powerful, versatile language used not only for client-side scripting but also for server-side development (with environments like Node.js), mobile app development, and more.
